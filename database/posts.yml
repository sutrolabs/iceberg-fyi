      AWS recently introduced default data integrity protections with strong integrity checksums
      in their S3 SDKs, which has broken compatibility with nearly all S3-compatible services
      including pre-2025 Minio, Vast, Dell EC, Cloudflare R2, and Tigris.

      The Apache Iceberg community has raised a PR to disable these checksums, and Trino project
      also had to temporarily disable the checks after receiving error reports.

      Turns out reusing AWS SDKs is probably not a good idea.

      AWS now offers Iceberg REST support for AWS Glue catalogs and with S3 Tables. They wrote a nice
      tutorial showing how to use PyIceberg (the official Python client for Iceberg) to create, query,
      and update tables stored in S3 Tables.

      It looks like Snowflake has added support for S3-compatible object stores, but you'll need to have their
      support team review your request first. The review process took less than 24 hours in our experience.
